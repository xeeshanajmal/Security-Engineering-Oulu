Task 1: What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber crimes?

Cyber crimes are on the rise and to protect myself I am using multiple methods. 
Firstly, I started educating myself about the latest threats and cybercrime methods. I am increasing my knowledge about phishing, identity theft, and social engineering. 
Secondly, I have activated multi-factor authentication for all critical applications like emails, social media, and bank accounts. 
Thirdly, for my computer and laptop, I have installed the antivirus and anti-malware and I keep their signatures up to date.
I have increased the complexity of my passwords and I keep changing them regularly. I donâ€™t save them in the browsers. I have put filters on my emails and I keep an eye out for spam emails containing links and pictures.
I am careful about connecting USB devices to my laptop and computer and I scan them thoroughly before connection.
And as a last option, I also made backups of my most important data and I keep them on a separate portable hard drive.
